- #### To get frontend up and running:

    - install yarn on your pc/mac ([yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable))
        - choose version 1.22.4 (cos yarn 2 may have issues with the code)
    - change into the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
    - run `yarn` in command line, this will take a while as it downloads and installs all dependencies
    - then run `yarn start` to get going...
